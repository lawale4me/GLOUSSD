/**
 * The interface <code>ServerPDUEventListener</code> defines method for processing
 * of PDUs received by the <code>Receiver</code> from the SMSC.
 * Implementation of this interface is used when the communication with
 * the SMSC is <i>asynchronous</i>. The asynchronous communication means that
 * the <code>Session</code> after sending a request to the SMSC doesn't wait for
 * a response to the request sent, instead it returns null. All PDUs received from the SMSC,
 * i.e  both responses to the sent requests and requests sent on behalf of
 * the SMSC, are passed to the instance of <code>ServerPDUEventListener</code>
 * implementation class. Users of the library are expected to implement
 * the listener.
 * <emp>Important:</emp>The <code>handleEvent</code> method is called
 * from the receiver's thread context, so the implementation of the listener
 * should ensure that there is no deadloock, or at least not too much
 * time spent in the method.
