 * Imported
 *
 * 
 * Old changelog:
 * 13-07-01 ticp@logica.com start(), stop(), setReceiveTimeout(),
 * 						    getReceiveTimeout(), setTermException(),
 *						    getTermException() made not synchronized;
 *						    receive(long) & receive(PDU) made synchronized
 *						    so the receiver no longer locks up
 * 13-07-01 ticp@logica.com the call to receiveAsync() in run() now enclosed
 *						    in try-finally and the status RCV_FINISHED
 *						    is set in finally block so the finished status
 *						    is now reported correctly even in case of exception
 * 13-07-01 ticp@logica.com some debug lines corrected; some added
 * 08-08-01 ticp@logica.com added support for Session's asynchronous processing capability
 * 23-08-01 ticp@logica.com added async capability exhibited that if more than
 *						    one pdu is read from connection at once (in one
 *						    connection.receive(), the additional ones aren't
 *						    processed. this behaviour was corrected.
 * 23-08-01 ticp@logica.com added yield() to run() to give chance to other

 * 26-09-01 ticp@logica.com debug code categorized to groups
 * 01-10-01 ticp@logica.com now derived from new ProcessingThread which implements
