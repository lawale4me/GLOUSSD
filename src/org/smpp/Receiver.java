/*
 * $Log: Receiver.java,v $
 * Revision 1.2  2003/12/16 14:38:31  sverkera
 * Bugfix from smsforum:
 * Without this code, although you just received a successful unbind_resp from the smsc, the connection object makes a blocking read call with a timeout of 60 seconds. After 60 seconds, when control returns the receiver is then shut down by the session. This is not acceptable for cases where you have a connection pool because
 * an attempt to retireConnection(conn) makes an attempt to unbind which blocks for a minute and causes all other threads sharing the pool to block. This defeats the purpose of connection pooling.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/07/23 00:28:39  sverkera
 * Imported
 *
 * 
 * Old changelog:
 * 13-07-01 ticp@logica.com start(), stop(), setQueueWaitTimeout() &
 *						    getQueueWaitTimeout() made not synchronized;
 *						    receive(long) & receive(PDU) made synchronized
 *						    so the receiver no longer locks up
 * 13-07-01 ticp@logica.com bug fixed in tryReceivePDU which caused that the PDUs
 *						    were never removed from the queue - now dequeue(expected)
 *						    is now used instead of find(expected)
 * 13-07-01 ticp@logica.com loads of debug lines corrected; some added
 * 08-08-01 ticp@logica.com added support for Session's asynchronous processing capability
 * 26-09-01 ticp@logica.com debug code categorized to groups
 * 01-10-01 ticp@logica.com added function getThreadName for ProcessingThread
 *						    thread name initialisation.
 * 02-10-01 ticp@logica.com instead of importing full packages only the used
 *						    classes are iported
