/**
 * The interface <code>Debug</code> is an interface to application specific
 * debug information trace facility. Users of the SMPP library can either
 * use one of the two implementations of the <code>Debug</code> interface --
 * <code>DefaultDebug</code> or <code>FileDebug</code> or they can implement
 * their own class or create an adapter to their legacy trace facility.
 * The SMPP library's root class, <code>SmppObject</code> contains
 * object of type <code>Debug</code> so that all descendants of the
 * <code>SmppObject</code> class can write trace lines.
 * <br>
 * The interface contains methods to write lines of trace information
 * and also support functions to structure the written information according
 * function call nesting. Morover, the users can group their tracing
 * code to groups according functional areas and turn on and of these
 * areas.
