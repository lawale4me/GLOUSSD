/**
 * This class represent one client connection to the server starting
 * by accepting the connection, authenticating of the client,
 * communication and finished by unbinding.
 * The <code>SMSCSession</code> object is generated by <code>SMSCListener</code>
 * which also sets the session's PDU processor. Session is run in separate
 * thread; it reads PDUs from the connection and calls PDU processor's
 * client methods to process the received PDUs. PDU processor on turn can
 * use the session to submit PDUs to the client.
 * For receiving and sending of PDUs the session uses instances of
 * <code>Receiver</code> and <code>Transmitter</code>.
